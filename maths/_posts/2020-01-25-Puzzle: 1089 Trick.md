# Puzzle - 1089 Trick

1. Think of a three digit number \\(abc\\) where \\(a - c\geq 2\\)
2. 

# Proof

The probability Player \\(m\\) wins is:

$$
\frac{1}{2^m}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{ni}} = \frac{1/2^m}{1-1/2^n}
$$

As a check we have

$$
\sum_{m=1}^{n}\frac{1/2^m}{1-1/2^n}
= \frac{1}{1-1/2^n}\sum_{m=1}^{n}{1/2^m}
= \frac{1}{1-1/2^n}\frac{1/2-1/2^{n+1}}{1-1/2}
= 1
$$
