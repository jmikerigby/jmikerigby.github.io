# Puzzle - Guess the polynomial

I am thinking of a polynomial with positive coefficients:

$$p(x)=a_n x^n+\ldots + a_1 x + a_0$$

where \\(a_0, \ldots, a_n \gt 0\\)

If you give me an \\(x\\) I will tell you the evaluation \\(p(x\\). After that you can have one more evaluation (Hint: you know the previous evaluation before your second go!).

Now tell me what is \\(p(x\\)?
